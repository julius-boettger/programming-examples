# Programming Examples
### Multiple projects, each showcasing a different programming language

Each project contains examples of the basic usage of a language, aiming to include variables, data types, control flow and structures, object oriented or functional programming patterns, ...

**These examples do not _aim to_ reflect all features a language provides**. I write them when learning new languages mostly for myself, as trying out each feature myself makes learning easier. As such, the amount of written examples directly correlates to my knowledge of the language.
